# sutra-ai
SutraAi is an AI orchestration gateway that dynamically routes requests between multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) — like GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini — based on latency, cost, and reasoning complexity. Built with Node.js, Fastify, Redis, BullMQ, and pgvector, it brings intelligence, observability, and scalability to multi-model AI systems.
